## Changes over stock:
- A BulletSharp fork with a much nicer kinematic character controller and an API giving you way more control
- Misc. quality of life things, some from Focus Engine
- Default gravity can be set in GameSettings
- Editor camera speed uses a min and a max value set in GUI, instead of an array of hardcoded steps, and the speed up/speed down keybinds are exposed
